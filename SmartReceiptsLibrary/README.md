Turn your phone into a receipt scanner and expense report generator with [Smart Receipts](https://www.smartreceipts.co/)! With Smart Receipts, you can track your receipts and easily generate beautiful PDF and CSV reports.

Download Smart Receipts on Google Play:

- [Smart Receipts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wb.receipts&referrer=utm_source%3Dcom.github.wbaumann.SmartReceiptsLibrary). The free version of the app, but it also supports an in-app purchase subscription.
- [Smart Receipts Plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wb.receiptspro&referrer=utm_source%3Dcom.github.wbaumann.SmartReceiptsLibrary). A 'paid' app from back before Google supported in-app purchases.

The free and plus versions versions are identical, except the plus version offers the following enhancements:

- The paid version has no ads
- The paid version supports automatic backups to Google Drive
- The paid version automatically processes exchange rate conversions
- The paid version allows you to automatically break down prices by category/payment method in your reports
- The paid version allows you to edit/customize the pdf report footer (by default, it is "Report Generated with Smart Receipts")

## Install 

Smart Receipts is broken into a few core modules:

- **app**. All common application code for both the `free` and `plusFlavor` flavors of the application are defined here. In practice, all development work should occur in this module
- **wBMiniLibrary**. A few legacy items that haven't been moved into the Library module, but it's otherwise unused.

To install, clone or pull down this project. Please note that it will **NOT** work out of the box, so you will need to add the following files to ensure it will compile:

- `app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml`. You can copy the secrets.xml.sample file and rename the keys inside to achieve this behavior. This is used for low usage keys
- `app/src/free/res/values/ads.xml`. The ads file in smartReceiptsFree. You can add `adUnitId` and `classicAdUnitId` to enable support for AdMob Native and Classic Ads, respectively.
- `app/src/free/res/xml/analytics.xml`. The analytics file in smartReceiptsFree. You can add a key here if you wish to enable Google Analytics.

Generally speaking, it's easier to test against SmartReceiptsPlus (ie Smart Receipts PlusFlavor), since there are less secrets that have been explicitly git ignored to avoid key leaks.

## Contribute

Contributions are always welcome! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/wbaumann/SmartReceiptsLibrary/issues/new) to report a bug or file a feature request to get started.

## Continuous Integration

We currently use Travis-CI for our continuous integration in order perform tests against new commits, allowing us to avoid potential regressions. You can monitor the current build status here:

- [https://travis-ci.com/wbaumann/SmartReceiptsLibrary](https://travis-ci.com/wbaumann/SmartReceiptsLibrary)

As we have save a few local API keys (e.g. for ads), we use encrypt a few files in our travis repository. You generate your own encrypted set as follows (note: please install the [Travis CLI client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb) first):

```bash
$ travis login --pro
$ tar cvf secrets.tar app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml app/src/free/res/values/ads.xml app/src/free/res/xml/analytics.xml
$ travis encrypt-file secrets.tar --add --pro
$ rm -f secrets.tar
```

This should automatically update our `.travis.yml` for the build.
