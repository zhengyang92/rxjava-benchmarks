/**
 * There are two types of messages data messages and notification messages. Data messages are handled
 * here in onMessageReceived whether the app is in the foreground or background. Data messages are the type
 * traditionally used with GCM. Notification messages are only received here in onMessageReceived when the app
 * is in the foreground. When the app is in the background an automatically generated notification is displayed.
 * When the user taps on the notification they are returned to the app. Messages containing both notification
 * and data payloads are treated as notification messages. The Firebase console always sends notification
 * messages. For more see: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options
